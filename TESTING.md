# Accessibility tests

* Accessibility tests were carried out on a Chrome / MacOS browser-device combination:

    * Tabs are working as expected on all pages.
    * Screen reader works as expected on all pages, with one minor issue, detailed in the [Known Bugs](#known-bugs) section.
* Colour contrasts were checked using [a11y Contrast Checker](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/). All pages passed the tests:
    * [About Page Contrast Check Result](assets/images/testing-images/a11y-contrast-about.pdf)
    * [Adopt Page Contrast Check Result](assets/images/testing-images/a11y-contrast-adopt.pdf)
    * [Contact Us Page Contrast Check Result](assets/images/testing-images/a11y-contrast-adopt.pdf)
* Further accessibility tests were done with Chrome Dev Tool's Lighthouse testing, [please see below](#lighthouse-tests).

# Lighthouse tests

Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO tests were carried out with [Google Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)' **Lighthouse** tool in `Incognito` mode. Results are not 100% consistent, there is always a few percent variation at each performed test.

Results:

| Device | Page | Mode | Result | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Mobile | About | light mode | ![Result-about-light-mobile](assets/images/testing-images/lighthouse-about-light-mode-mobile.jpeg)|
| Mobile | About | dark mode | ![Result-about-dark-mobile](assets/images/testing-images/lighthouse-about-dark-mode-mobile.jpeg)|

| Desktop | Contact Us | dark mode | ![Result-contact-dark-desktop](assets/images/testing-images/lighthouse-about-dark-mode-desktop.jpeg)|

The lower performance scores were mainly caused by the way Bootstrap loads before the first render:

# Peer Review

In our dedicated Peer Code Review channel, five people reviewed my site and gave mainly positive feedback. I incorporated one suggestion regarding my rabbit gallery section. It was noted that the pictures are not clearly distinguishable from each other as there were no border or gaps between the pictures. I rectified this by adding small gaps around the pictures.

# Bugs

## Resolved Bugs

* The screen reader could not convey meaning from some of the icons. 
    * Solution: aria-labels were added to all these icons' tags.
* Current page was wrongly identified by the sceen reader.
    * Solution: aria-current was corrected.
* Google Map's `<iframe>` was not changing colour in dark mode.
    * Solution: Properly customising the google maps iframe in dark mode would require an API_KEY which can not be safely embedded into HTML files, so dark-mode colours are achieved by just filtering the maps' colours in css. The `hue-rotate`, `invert` and `contrast` properties were set to achieve darker colours.
* A friend of mine flagged the issue that main pictures on `About` and `Adopt` pages do not load in an older version (15.6.1 or earlier) of Safari. That was because I converted these images in `.webp` format to achieve significantly better performance score in Lighthouse. While `.webp` format is now widely accepted by all modern browsers, Safari was indeed the last one to implement this option from its version 16.0 in September 2022. Since this latest update is fairly recent, I decided not to ignore this issue but to add to all images an extra version in `.png` format as a backup. I elaborated on this solution in the [Imagery](./README.md#imagery) section of the [README.md](./README.md) file.

## Known Bugs

* When the screen reader is reading the `Adopt Page`'s main text, the reading stops before every highlighted text. I googled the issue, looked at local forums and asked advice on a specified slack channel, but found no solution. While this issue is an inconvenience, it does not block the availability of the content to the user.
