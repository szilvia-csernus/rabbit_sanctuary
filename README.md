# Website for a Fictional Rabbit Rescue Charity

This responsive website was created as the 1st Milestone Project for Code Institute's web application development course using HTML5, CSS3 and BOOTSTRAP 5.

HOPPER Rabbit Rescue is a fictional non-profit organisation. The website is designed to aid the charity's mission which is to help find new homes for rescued rabbits as well as to help potential donors and volunteers to find the charity.

---------

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)


### Website Owner's Goals

* To help local people find the organisation for the primary purpose of rehoming a rescued rabbit.
* To aid potential donors and volunteers willing to contribute to the charity's work.
* To allow visitors to make contact with the organisation.
* The website to be responsive with simple structure and clear 'call to action' messages.

### First time visitors' Goals

* To find the relevant information quickly, be it adoption, volunteering or donation info.
* To be able to find the location quickly.
* To be able to make contact with the charity for relevant requests effectively.

### Returning visitors' Goals

* Returning visitors' goals are the same as those of first time visitors, as the website is not designed to update frequently, returning visitors would come to the site for the same reasons as first time visitors.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

Colour choice was made in line with industry norms and customer expectations, green being primarily chosen for animal charity organisations. Orange was chosen as an accent colour to emphasize the 'call to action' messages. In addition, various shades of greys were added to complement the two main colours.

The exact shades of green and orange were sampled from the hero image of the landing page.

Colors were tested for accessibility and contrast with the help of material.io's COLOR TOOL

Primary colour (green): hhttps://m2.material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=11644d

Accent colour (orange): https://m2.material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=cc4b00

Grey on white background (main text): https://m2.material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=ffffff&primary.text.color=616161

Dark grey text on light grey background (Home Page's mission statement):
https://m2.material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=1&primary.color=EDEDED&primary.text.color=616161



### Typography

Typography choice was made with the help of a font pairing website https://typ.io.
Nunito and Nunito Sans were chosen from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) library for their simplicity, legibility and fairly informal feel. These fonts' conservative look increases trust towards the organisation.


If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

Free images were chosen from the Pexels and Unsplash websites.

### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

###  Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
