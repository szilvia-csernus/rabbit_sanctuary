## Design

All wireframes and design were created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

### Colour Scheme

Colour choice was made in line with industry norms and customer expectations, green being the most frequent choice for for animal charity organisations. Orange was chosen as an accent colour to emphasize the 'call to action' messages. In addition, various shades of greys were added to complement the two main colours.

Primary and accent colours were sampled from the hero image of the landing page, then slightly modified to satisfy accessibility requirements.

![Dark mode palette:](assets/readme-images/dark-palette.png)

### Typography

Typography choice was made with the help of a font pairing website [Typ.io](https://typ.io/lists).
[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) and [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans) were selected from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) library for their simplicity, legibility and fairly informal feel. These fonts' conservative look increases trust towards the organisation. 

### Imagery

Free images were chosen from [Pexels](https://pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) websites.
Feature rabbit icon was custom created by the author of the site, other icons were downloaded from [svgrepo](https://svgrepo.com/) and edited in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

### Wireframes - Low & High Fidelity Designs

All design was created by the author of the site width [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

## Accessibility

* All colours were tested to have sufficient contrast.
* All relevant elements that have implied meanings are labelled with aria-labels to be accessible for screen readers. 

* Fonts were chosen to be simple with clean contours to maximize legibility. 

* For font-sizes, 'rem' were used throughout the site instead of 'px' to allow the text to scale according to the users' preferred default font-size.

All colors were tested for contrast with the help of [Color Palette Contrast Checker](https://color-contrast-checker.deque.com/)

![light-mode-colors-nr1](assets/readme-images/light-mode-colors-nr1.jpeg)
![light-mode-colors-nr2](assets/readme-images/light-mode-colors-nr2.jpeg)
![dark-mode-colors-nr1](assets/readme-images/dark-mode-colors-nr1.jpeg)
![dark-mode-colors-nr2](assets/readme-images/dark-mode-colors-nr2.jpeg)

All pages on all screen sizes in both light and dark mode passed Lighthouse's accessibility test with 100%.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

### Code Used

* BOOTSTRAP 5.2 was used to create the menu bar, the modals, the forms and the responsive layouts.

In addition, I also used ideas from various online sources for:

* making svg icons responsive: https://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color/ by Chris Coyier https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/

* generating dark-mode responsive favicons https://realfavicongenerator.net/svg-favicon/

* using images in HTML in different sizes to improve performance:

* adding backup image in .png format for older Safari users

###  Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
